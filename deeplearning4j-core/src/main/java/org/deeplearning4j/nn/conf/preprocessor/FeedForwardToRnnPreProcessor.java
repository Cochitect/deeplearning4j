/**A preprocessor to allow RNN and feed-forward network layers to be used together.<br>
 * For example, DenseLayer -> GravesLSTM<br>
 * This does two things:<br>
 * (a) Reshapes activations out of FeedFoward layer (which is 2D with shape 
 * [miniBatchSize*timeSeriesLength,layerSize]) into 3d activations (with shape
 * [miniBatchSize,layerSize,timeSeriesLength]) suitable to feed into RNN layers.<br>
 * (b) Reshapes 3d epsilons (weights*deltas from RNN layer, with shape
 * [miniBatchSize,layerSize,timeSeriesLength]) into 2d epsilons (with shape
 * [miniBatchSize*timeSeriesLength,layerSize]) for use in feed forward layer
 * @author Alex Black
 * @see RnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor for opposite case (i.e., GravesLSTM -> DenseLayer etc)
